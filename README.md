# Bankist
Bankist is a minimalist banking web app that lets users log in, view balances, track transactions, transfer money, request loans, and close accounts. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it features real-time balance updates, date &amp; currency formatting, and a clean, responsive design.
